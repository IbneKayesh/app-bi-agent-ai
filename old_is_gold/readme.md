Prompt 1:
Act as a master of business report, local, AI automation / Agent development engineer.


Prompt 2:
Storyline:
I've a small shop database in SQLite, table contains flat data set with Table_Sales with columns Shop_Name, Order_No, Order_Date, Invoice_No, Invoice_Date, Item_Name, Item_Category_Name, Item_Qty, Item_Rate, Customer_Name, Customer_Address, Delivery_Date, Delivery_Charge. Want to generate report from this table.

What I want?
An AI agent like talkative chatbot, where user will ask  questions about business reports, and the agent will generate the appropriate SQL queries to fetch the data from the SQLite3 database. The agent should be able to understand natural human language queries and translate them into accurate SQL statements that can be executed against the report database. The agent should also be capable of explaining the results in a user-friendly manner, providing insights and summaries based on the data retrieved.
result will be -
response : {
    SQL Query:
    Response Summary:
    Suggession: 
}

AI Agent becomes self-learning:
database  schema, table names, column names, column data format in JSON file.
{
  "database": "shop.db",
  "tables": [
    {
      "name": "Table_Sales",
      "columns": [
        {"name": "Shop_Name", "type": "TEXT"},
        {"name": "Order_No", "type": "TEXT"},
        {"name": "Order_Date", "type": "DATE"},
        {"name": "Invoice_No", "type": "TEXT"},
        {"name": "Invoice_Date", "type": "DATE"},
        {"name": "Item_Name", "type": "TEXT"},
        {"name": "Item_Category_Name", "type": "TEXT"},
        {"name": "Item_Qty", "type": "INTEGER"},
        {"name": "Item_Rate", "type": "REAL"},
        {"name": "Customer_Name", "type": "TEXT"},
        {"name": "Customer_Address", "type": "TEXT"},
        {"name": "Delivery_Date", "type": "DATE"},
        {"name": "Delivery_Charge", "type": "REAL"}
      ],
      "synonyms": {
        "Shop_Name": ["shop name"],
        "Order_No": ["order no", "order number", "order"],
        "Order_Date": ["order date", "start date", "date"],
        "Invoice_No": ["challan", "challan no", "challan number", "invoice no"],
        "Invoice_Date": ["challan date", "invoice date"],
        "Item_Name": ["item", "product", "product name"],
        "Item_Category_Name": ["category", "item category", "category name"],
        "Item_Qty": ["quantity", "qty", "count"],
        "Item_Rate": ["rate", "price", "unit price"],
        "Customer_Name": ["customer", "buyer"],
        "Delivery_Date": ["delivery date", "delivered on"],
        "Delivery_Charge": ["delivery fee", "shipping"]
      },
      "purpose": "Records all sales transactions with products, customer details and amount."
    }
  ]
}

This sqlite schema structure , synonyms and purpose of the table and columns data will use for training purpose.

User will give feedback  on the results, and the agent should be able to refine the queries based on the feedback. The agent should also be able to handle  complex SQL
queries. self-training use  of feedback to improve query accuracy over time. User also give positive and negetive sentiment by like/dislike button. All the chats will store in sqlite and used for training.

Automatically captures every user interaction.
Learns linguistic variations.
Refines intent/entity recognition.
Evolves without developer intervention.

Example?
Q: Would you please show them category wise?
A: Confectionary 70, Beverage 50, Grocery 30

Q: Today Sales amount of Pine apple biscuit?
Q: Last 20 days total sales of Grocery category, with columns category name, sales amount, sales date
Q: how many orders today? also give yesterday and today comparison in percentage.
Q: Compare sales between last 4 month in table format


Prompt 3:
Technology:
backend-app/NodeJS API
backend-app/db/SQLite3 database
frontend-app/React JS


1. User Interface (UI):
    - Web-based interface for users to input natural language queries and view results.
    - Display options for data visualization (charts, tables).
    - Real-time interaction with the AI agent.

2. Backend Server (Node.js + Express):
    - RESTful API endpoints to handle user requests.

3. AI Agent (NLP + SQL Generation):
    - Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module to parse user queries.
    - Query Translation module to convert NLU output into SQL.
    - Result Interpretation module to summarize and explain data. 

4. List of libraries (mention what purpose use it)

The AI Agent should run offline and locally without internet, must be light weight and work without GPU hardware.
A robust architecture for the local AI Agent, including the components and their interactions.
Think longer but reply in short description format, will execute it and step by step, I'll thank you for a perfect solution.



Prompt 4:
The agent will process the natural language query, generate the appropriate SQL query only, execute it against the SQLite database.
Should avoid non-relevant questions, like -

Q: Which country is the best for living?
A: Sorry, I don't undestand your query.

Q: Sales value of iPhone 17 Pro max and Air?
A: (Generate SQL and Show result to user)

Q: Is the weather warm or cold?
A: Sorry, I don't undestand your query.

You suggested - HW guidance: 4+ CPU cores, 16GB RAM recommended for 7B quantized; for very light setups pick 1â€“3B models (lower RAM).
I pick only 2 core CPU with 4GB RAM for very specific AI agent only for SQL query generation and think this will work fine for my use case. 
with handle at least  50 concurrent users.

Node JS - with Express JS  
React JS - with Prime react UI

Think longer, and give me summary of real context.






Prompt 5:















I'll let you know after your response.
